# Startup Namer
A simple flutter mobile app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code generates ten names at a time. As the user scrolls, new batches of names are generated. The user can tap the list icon in the upper right of the app bar to move to a new route that lists only the favorited names. </br></br>
